 * threads.  Each thread increments the counter a
 * specified number of times.  After all the threads
 * have completed, the value of the counter is 
 * printed out so it can be compared to the correct
 * value.  The user specifies the number of threads
 * and the number of times each thread increments the
 * counter.  (To see an error, the number of increments
 * probably has to be pretty large.  Try 1000000.)
